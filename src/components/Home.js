            The Engineering Peer Tutoring Service is a free tutoring service for
            U0 and U1 engineering students sponsored by the Faculty of
            Engineering. Tutorial office hours are held on a weekly basis in the
            McGill Engineering Student Centre on the ground floor of the Frank
            Dawson Adams Building, Room 6B. (Tutoring was temporarily held in
            FDA 3 due to construction, but we are now in our normal room again)
            EPTS tutors can answer some of the most challenging questions and
            help give students what they need to obtain results in their
            respective field of study. EPTS also offers direct contact with an
            upper-year student who has already been through the program!
